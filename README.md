Amazing work with Machine Lerning


###BIKE PRICE PREDICTION###
 In this project, I will take you through the task of Bike Price Prediction with Machine Learning by using the Python programming language. Bike Price prediction is the task of Machine Learning so I will be using the   Random Forest   Algorithms in Python.
 Aim: -   To predict price of the Old bike Using Machine learning techniques with the help of MOTORCYCLE dataset CSV file.  I have collected data set from Kaggle data set which is Domain name is BIKEWALE [MOTORCYCLE]


Lets start projects, 
The first step is create a create folder and create conda environment 
Then set the Path of the folder with file 
Then create a new file which Jupyter notebook 


1.	Import all library’s   which have we need 
•	import pandas as pd
•	import NumPy as np
•	import seaborn as sns
•	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
•	import warnings
•	from pandas_profilling import profile_Report
•	import pandas_profiling
•	from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesRegressor
•	form sklearning.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
•	form sklearn .model_selection import RandmizedSearchCV
•	form sklearn import matrice
•	import pickle
1.	Feature Engineering:
	Load the dataset form local system.
	To check information of the dataset
	To check Unique value of two variable seller type and owner type
	To check missing value.
	To check shape of the dataset
	To describe the dataset
	To add current year column in data frame 
	To subtract the new column by year column
	To check correlation final dataset
	To create pair plot dataset
	To check correlation the each features in the dataset.
	To create heatmap of the dataset

2.	Feature Selections:
	To select feature importance
	To plot graph of feature importance for better visualization
	Train test split the data set
	To find out best parameter
	Hyperparameter tuning 
	Randomized search cv

3.	Model Creation:
	To Create the random grid
	To Use the random grid to search for best hyperparameters
	To First create the base model to tune
	Random search of parameters, using 3 fold cross validation,
	search across 100 different combinations

4.	Prediction Model:
	To create folder to save all file of the project
	Create conda environment 
	To set path of the folder of project
	Create app.py file
	Create index.html 
	Crete requirement.txt file
5.	Deployment:
	To create account on github 
	To Upload project on github
	To create account on Heroku cloud platform
	To connect github to Heroku 
	Deploy the main branch
	Heroku has given Link of the project
